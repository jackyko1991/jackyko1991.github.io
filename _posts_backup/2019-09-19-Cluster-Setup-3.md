**Slurm** (Simple Linux Utility for Resource Management) is a free and open source job scheduler for Linux and Unix kernel supercomputer and clusters. The software is currently used as the workload manager on about 60% of the Top 500 supercomputers.

You may get deeper look at Slurm through the official [documentations](https://slurm.schedmd.com/documentation.html) and [tutorials](https://slurm.schedmd.com/tutorials.html). Here we only provide a minimal tutorial on GPU cluster setup.
