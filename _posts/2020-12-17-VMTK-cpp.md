**The Vascular Modeling Toolkit (VMTK)** is library collection for 3D reconstruction, geometric analysis, mesh generation and surface data analysis for image-based modeling of blood vessels. The toolkit is developed by Orobix srl whicch can run standalone with VMTK scripts, Python or C++ library, or as an extension to the medical image processing platform 3D Slicer.

The standalone and Python (Pype) method is described in detail in the [tutorial section of VMTK official site](http://www.vmtk.org/tutorials/). Here we provide the instruction for C++ users to integrate VMTK with CMake medical image processing toolchain.

## Compile C++ Interface from Source
For developers interested to develop vascular modeling toolkit with CMake medical image processing toolchain, you should first get familiar with [CMake and the Qt-VTK-ITK build](./2020-12-16-CMake-Medical-Image-Toolchain.md) procedures. 

### CMake Configuration
VMTK provide SuperBuild options for standalone build. Here we would prefer to use our own VTK-ITK toolchain for greater control on dependencies.

#### ITK Configuration
Make sure ITK is built with `Module_ITKVtkGlue:BOOL=ON` to have ITK-VTK bind. Following options are necessary for VMTK dependency or else built error will appear:

```cmake
Module_ITKReview:BOOL=ON
ITK_USE_SYSTEM_DOUBLECONVERSION=ON
```

#### VMTK Configuration

``` cmake
BUILD_DOCUMENTATION:BOOL=OFF
BUILD_SHARED_LIBS:BOOL=ON
VTK_VMTK_WRAP_PYTHON:BOOL=OFF

# Use system VTK and ITK
VMTK_USE_SUPERBUILD:BOOL=OFF
USE_SYSTEM_VTK:BOOL=ON
USE_SYSTEM_ITK:BOOL=ON
```

## VMTK in C++ and Python
You should first get yourself familiar with VTK coding in C++. VMTK works very similar to VTK smartpointer syntax ([VTK C++ Example](http://www.vtk.org/Wiki/VTK/Examples/Cxx)). Once you understand the working principle of VTK, you will get used to VMTK.

### vmtkScripts
VMTK work as standalone software with PypeS script. The VMTK PypeS script are available on the [Github repo](https://github.com/vmtk/vmtk/tree/master/vmtkScripts) and you may checkout the basic tutorial [here](http://www.vmtk.org/tutorials/PypesBasic.html).

### Change from Python to C++
As a basic illustration on converting vmtkScripts to C++ development, we use the example of centerline extraction filter (https://github.com/vmtk/vmtk/blob/master/vmtkScripts/vmtkcenterlines.py).

What we most concern is the `Execute` function, where PypeS actually call VMTK functions. PypeS glue VTK and VMTK functions in Python. The function name of VTK and VMTK are the same in both Python and C++ interface. To calculate polydata centerline, the class `vtkvmtkPolyDataCenterlines` is the core part to do the work. The class documentation (http://www.vmtk.org/doc/html/classvtkvmtkPolyDataCenterlines.html) does not provide detail description of like VTK. Therefore we need to refer the class functions from python examples.

Follow illustrate the class in both languages:

#### Python

```python
from vmtk import vtkvmtk

centerlineFilter = vtkvmtk.vtkvmtkPolyDataCenterlines()
centerlineFilter.SetInputData(centerlineInputSurface)
centerlineFilter.SetSourceSeedIds(inletSeedIds)
centerlineFilter.SetTargetSeedIds(outletSeedIds)
centerlineFilter.SetRadiusArrayName("Radius")
centerlineFilter.SetEdgeArrayName("Edge")
centerlineFilter.SetEdgePCoordArrayName("PCoord")
centerlineFilter.SetAppendEndPointsToCenterlines(True)
centerlineFilter.SetCenterlineResampling(True)
centerlineFilter.SetResamplingStepLength(1)
centerlineFilter.Update()
```

#### C++
```cpp
#include <vtkvmtkPolyDataCenterlines.h>

vtkSmartPointer<vtkvmtkPolyDataCenterlines> centerlineFilter = vtkSmartPointer<vtkvmtkPolyDataCenterlines>::New();
centerlineFilter->SetInputData(centerlineInputSurface);
centerlineFilter->SetSourceSeedIds(inletSeedIds);
centerlineFilter->SetTargetSeedIds(outletSeedIds);
centerlineFilter->SetAppendEndPointsToCenterlines(true);
centerlineFilter->SetCenterlineResampling(true);
centerlineFilter->SetResamplingStepLength(1);
centerlineFilter->SetRadiusArrayName("Radius");
centerlineFilter->SetEdgeArrayName("Edge");
centerlineFilter->SetEdgePCoordArrayName("PCoord");
centerlineFilter->Update();
```

## Associate Software
### [VMTK Slicer Module](https://www.slicer.org/wiki/Slicer4:VMTK)
VMTK is available through the extension manager for 3D Slicer from version 4.6.2. Main difference to the Slicer3 version is that now all VMTK modules come as one extension bundle.
